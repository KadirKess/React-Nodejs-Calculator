# Simple Calculator

This project is a simple calculator application built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.

The entire project could have been done in React.js, but I wanted to demonstrate how to build a full-stack application using React.js and Node.js.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Then run the following commands to install the dependencies and start the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

3. After going back to the root directory with another terminal, run the following commands to install the dependencies and start the frontend server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

4. Access the calculator by visiting [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) in your web browser.
